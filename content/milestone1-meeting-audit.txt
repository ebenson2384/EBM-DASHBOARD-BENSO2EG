# Milestone 1 — Meeting Audit Checklist

Purpose: Rapid checklist to assess meeting design quality and decision documentation for recurring meetings.

For each sampled meeting, record:
- Meeting name / recurring series
- Organizer / team
- Frequency and typical duration
- Number of attendees
- Was an agenda shared in advance? (Yes / No)
- Was the meeting timeboxed? (Yes / No)
- Were roles defined (facilitator, note-taker)? (Yes / No)
- Was a clear decision or next step recorded? (Yes / No)
- Was an owner assigned for next steps? (Yes / No)
- Was there a shared record (notes, doc, ticket) of decisions? (Yes / No)
- Follow-up actions completed on time? (Yes / No / Not applicable)
- Auditor notes (free text):
  - Main themes: unnecessary attendees, lack of decisions, rehashing prior topics, unclear owners

Sampling guidance
- Audit 10–20 recurring meetings across different levels (senior leadership, middle-management, operational teams)
- Prioritize high-frequency meetings and cross-functional meetings

Analysis
- Calculate % of meetings with agenda, % with decisions recorded, % with owners assigned
- Identify common patterns (teams with low scores, meeting types that are poor candidates for synchronous time)

Recommendations
- For meeting series that fail the checklist, recommend either redesign (agenda, owners, timebox) or convert to async update.
- Use audit results to select pilot teams.

I can also produce a spreadsheet template (CSV) to collect these audit fields for easier aggregation.
