# Milestone 1 — Evidence Collection Plan

Purpose
Collect focused, pragmatic evidence to confirm the communication problem, measure baselines, and evaluate the chosen solution.

Key Questions
- Does the problem exist (scope and severity)?
- What are the root causes (meetings, tooling, manager behavior)?
- Which metrics best capture improvement?

Data Sources & Methods
1. Quantitative
  - Internal employee survey: 5–7 items focused on communication clarity, meeting effectiveness, and responsiveness. Sample: all staff (or representative sample of ~30–50% for large orgs).
  - System metrics: meeting hours per person (calendar analytics), email/slack response times (if available), number of threads vs. decisions logged.
  - Productivity KPIs (if applicable): delivery lead time, incident resolution time.

2. Qualitative
  - 8–12 semi-structured interviews with a cross-section of staff (senior leaders, middle managers, front-line employees).
  - 2–3 focus groups (30–60 minutes) for deeper themes.
  - Review of recent meeting notes, decisions, and project communications.

Instruments & Templates
- Short Survey (Likert 1–5 + open comment)
- Interview guide (questions by stakeholder type)
- Meeting audit checklist (agenda presence, stated outcomes, owner, follow-ups)

Sampling & Timeline
- Week 1: Launch brief survey and calendar/tool audit
- Weeks 2–3: Conduct interviews and focus groups
- Week 3–4: Compile baseline metrics and draft findings

Roles & Responsibilities
- Owner: Project lead (you or delegate)
- HR: survey distribution and confidentiality
- IT: export calendar/communication metrics (if available)
- L&D: support interviews/focus groups

Analysis & Deliverables
- Baseline summary (numbers + verbatim themes)
- Short evidence memo answering: Is the problem real? How severe? Likely root causes?
- Updated Milestone 1 documents with evidence footnotes and recommended solution option.

Ethics & Confidentiality
- Anonymize interview notes and survey responses
- Share high-level themes with stakeholders; reserve sensitive quotes for private review

After you pick a solution option, I will tailor the survey and interview guides to focus on the causes relevant to that option and produce files you can copy into your project's `content/` folder or send to HR/IT.
