# Milestone 1 — Pulse Survey (2–4 minutes)

Purpose: Quick baseline measurement of communication clarity, meeting effectiveness, and manager support for improved practices.

Instructions for distribution: Send org-wide (or to pilot teams) with anonymous responses; target 30–60% response rate for meaningful guidance.

Survey items (Likert 1–5 unless noted)
1. I understand the priorities for my team. (1=Strongly disagree, 5=Strongly agree)
2. Meetings I attend have a clear agenda. (1–5)
3. Meetings I attend end with clear next steps and assigned owners. (1–5)
4. I spend a reasonable amount of time in meetings each week. (1–5)
5. My manager communicates decisions clearly. (1–5)
6. I can usually find written notes or decisions after a meeting (shared doc, email, or tool). (1–5)
7. I can complete focused work without frequent interruption. (1–5)
8. How many hours did you spend in meetings last week? (open numeric)
9. Which meeting types are most unproductive? (multiple select / short list)

If you want, I can convert this into a Google Form or a short MS Forms template and provide shareable links/text for HR to paste directly.
