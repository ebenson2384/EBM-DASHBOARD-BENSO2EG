# Milestone 1 — Solution Options

This file presents two coherent solution options to address the communication problem identified in the dashboard ("How to improve communication in the work place"). Each option includes a short description, rationale, expected outcomes, resources required, risks, and a draft implementation outline.

Option A — Meeting Norms + Manager Coaching (Recommended when the main pain comes from inefficient synchronous meetings and unclear manager expectations)
- Description: Introduce a set of company-wide meeting norms (agenda-first meetings, timeboxing, clear roles, and standing notes) combined with a targeted manager coaching program (1-day workshop + follow-up coaching) to improve meeting design, decision clarity, and follow-through.
- Rationale: Many communication problems stem from inefficient meetings and inconsistent manager behavior. Norms plus coaching change both process and leadership practice.
- Expected outcomes: Reduced meeting hours (~20%), improved clarity in decisions, increased employee satisfaction with communication, faster task handoffs.
- Key activities and timeline (0–3 months):
  1. Design meeting norms (Week 1)
  2. Pilot with 2–3 teams (Weeks 2–4)
  3. Manager workshop (Week 4)
  4. Rollout & toolkit (Weeks 5–8)
  5. Monitor & iterate (Weeks 9–12)
- Resources: HR + L&D to run workshops, time allocation for managers, simple templates and an internal comms page.
- Risks: Manager resistance; perceived additional work; patchy adoption.
- Mitigations: Sponsor from senior leadership; clear short pilot with quick wins; manager coaching follow-up.

Option B — Async Tooling + Communication Guidelines (Recommended when the problem is poor asynchronous practices and missing tooling conventions)
- Description: Adopt or better-configure an async communication platform (e.g., Slack guidelines, threads, shared docs, and a central async playbook) and provide team-level training for async-first norms.
- Rationale: Async-first practices reduce unnecessary meetings, allow flexible working, and create persistent, searchable context.
- Expected outcomes: Faster response clarity on critical items, fewer interrupt-driven meetings, better documented decisions.
- Key activities and timeline (0–3 months):
  1. Audit current tools & patterns (Week 1)
  2. Define async playbook & channel conventions (Weeks 2–3)
  3. Team trainings & champions (Weeks 4–6)
  4. Tool configuration (e.g., channels, policies) (Weeks 4–6)
  5. Monitor & iterate (Weeks 7–12)
- Resources: IT for tool configuration, comms for playbook dissemination, training time.
- Risks: Tool fatigue; over-reliance on messages instead of decisions; inconsistent use.
- Mitigations: Clear playbook, champions, and measurement focused on quality of messages and decision rates.

Comparison and recommendation
- If most complaints are about long, unproductive meetings and unclear manager expectations, choose Option A.
- If the organization lacks clear async norms or tools are misused, choose Option B.
- A blended approach is common: pilot Option A in teams with heavy meeting loads and Option B in distributed teams.
