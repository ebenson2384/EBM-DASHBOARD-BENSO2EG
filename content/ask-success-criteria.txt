# Success Criteria Definition — Option A (Meeting Norms + Manager Coaching)

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: Increase communication satisfaction (Primary Outcome)
- **Specific:** Improve the internal communication satisfaction score measured by pulse survey items related to meeting effectiveness and clarity.
- **Measurable:** Aim to increase the composite score from baseline (example: 55/100) to 75/100.
- **Achievable:** Pilot with 2–3 teams and roll out organization-wide; realistic with manager coaching and playbook.
- **Relevant:** Directly addresses meeting quality, manager behaviors, and clarity.
- **Time-bound:** Achieve target within 6 months of full rollout.

### Criterion 2: Increase average monthyl meeting hours (Secondary Outcome)
- **Specific:** Increase average monthly calendar time spent in meetings per employee.
- **Measurable:** Increase by 20% from baseline (e.g., 9 hours/month → 12 hours/month).
- **Achievable:** Through norms, agendas, and timeboxing; pilot shows quick wins.
- **Relevant:** Creates time to imporve communication and improve autonomy.
- **Time-bound:** 3 months to realize initial improvements; maintain/improve by 6 months.

### Criterion 3: Improve decision clarity and follow-through (Additional Outcome)
- **Specific:** Increase the share of meetings with an explicit decision and an assigned owner.
- **Measurable:** Target 80% of recurring meetings to include a documented decision/next-step owner.
- **Achievable:** Use meeting templates and manager coaching.
- **Relevant:** Reduces repeated discussions and increases accountability.
- **Time-bound:** 3 months for pilot teams, 6 months org-wide.

## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics
- Survey: communication satisfaction composite (baseline & follow-ups)
- Calendar analytics: average meeting hours per person per week
- Meeting audit: % of meetings with agenda, documented decisions, and assigned owners

### Qualitative Indicators
- Interview themes reporting improved clarity
- Manager self-reports of reduced coordination time
- Participant feedback from workshops

## Baseline Measurements
- Current State Metrics (examples — replace with org values):
	- Communication satisfaction: 55/100
	- Average meeting hours per week: 12h
	- % meetings with documented decisions: 30%

### Data Collection Plan
- Week 1: Run baseline pulse survey and calendar audit
- Weeks 2–4: Interviews and meeting audits
- Ongoing: Weekly measurement for pilot teams; monthly rollout metrics after expansion

## Success Thresholds
### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
- Communication satisfaction increases by at least 10 points (55 → 65) within 6 months.

### Target Performance Level
- Communication satisfaction reaches 75/100 and meeting hours reduce by 20% within 6 months.

### Stretch Goal
- Communication satisfaction ≥ 80/100 and meeting hours reduce by ≥30% within 6 months.

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria
### Management Success Measures
- Visible reduction in coordination time and improved on-time delivery for prioritized projects.

### Employee Success Measures
- Reported reduction in meeting overload and higher perceived clarity in follow-ups.

### Customer Success Measures
- Faster response times for customer queries tied to clearer internal coordination.

## Risk Indicators
- Persistent high meeting hours after pilot
- Low workshop attendance or manager engagement
- Negative feedback about increased workload for workshop activities

### Red Flags
- Less than 5% reduction in meeting hours at pilot completion
- No change in survey scores after first 3 months

### Mitigation Triggers
- Pivot to more targeted coaching; adjust workshop format or mandate participation for managers

## Timeline for Assessment
### Short-term (30-90 days)
- Pilot workshops delivered; initial meeting hours reduction; early participant feedback collected

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- Rollout to additional teams; measurable improvements in survey scores and meeting hours

### Long-term (6-12 months)
- Sustained norms and leadership behaviors, organization-wide measurement and governance

## Reporting Framework
- Dashboard metrics: communication satisfaction, meeting hours, % meetings with decisions
- Regular Reports: monthly pilot reports and executive summary at 3 and 6 months
- Milestone Reviews: 6-month formal evaluation and decision on broader embedding
