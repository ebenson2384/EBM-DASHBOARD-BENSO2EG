# Scientific Evidence — Methods & Acquisition Strategy

This document provides a reproducible template for searching, selecting, and appraising scientific evidence relevant to your problem and proposed solutions.

## 1) Research Question (PICO-ish)
- Population: Employees in small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) with identified communication challenges
- Intervention/Exposure: Communication Skills Training (CST) programs, peer coaching, or structured feedback systems
- Comparator: No intervention or alternative training approaches
- Outcomes: Communication competency, self-efficacy, employee satisfaction, performance metrics

**Primary research question:** What are the main barriers (cultural, linguistic, hierarchical, technological) to effective communication, and how do they affect employee performance and satisfaction?

**Secondary question:** What are the most effective communication skills training (CST) methods for improving employee competence, self-efficacy, and empathy?

## 2) Search strategy

### Databases (recommend start list)
- PubMed/MEDLINE
- PsycINFO
- Business Source Complete / ABI/INFORM
- Google Scholar (broad sweep)
- Cochrane Library (reviews)
- JSTOR / SSRN for complementary literature

### Example search strings
- ("communication skills" OR "communication training" OR "interpersonal communication") AND ("workplace" OR "employee" OR "organizational")
- ("communication training" AND "randomized")

### Keywords and search terms

#### Primary keywords
- Active listening
- Communication styles
- Leadership communication
#### Secondary keywords
- Conflict resolution
- Feedback mechanisms
- Communication barriers
#### Example Boolean combinations
- ("communication skills" OR "communication training") AND ("workplace" OR "employee")
- ("communication training" AND (randomized OR trial OR intervention))
- ("peer coaching" OR "feedback system") AND ("employee" OR "staff")

### Filters to apply
- Date range: last 10 years (adjust if you need historical context)
- Language: English (expand if you read other languages)
- Study types: randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, cohort, systematic reviews

---

## 3) Selection criteria

### Inclusion
- Empirical studies evaluating communication interventions in workplace settings
- Adult working populations (exclude child/education settings unless directly relevant)
- Studies reporting at least one quantitative outcome (competence, satisfaction, retention, productivity)

### Exclusion
- Opinion pieces, editorials, narrative essays without empirical data
- Studies in clinical contexts where findings are not transferable to workplace settings

---

## 4) Screening & extraction (process)

Recommended workflow:
1. Run searches and export results to your reference manager (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote).
2. Remove duplicates.
3. Title/abstract screen against inclusion/exclusion criteria (track reasons for exclusion).
4. Retrieve full texts for potentially eligible papers.
5. Extract key data into a spreadsheet or extraction form.

### Suggested extraction fields
- Citation
- Country / setting
- Study design
- Sample size and characteristics
- Intervention details (duration, modality)
- Comparator
- Outcome measures and instruments
- Effect sizes / key results
- Risk of bias / limitations

---

## 5) Quality appraisal

Use a simple checklist per study (adapt for design):
- Was allocation/randomization adequate? (if RCT)
- Was there blinding where possible?
- Was attrition reported and handled appropriately?
- Were outcomes measured with validated instruments?
- Were analyses appropriate and clearly reported?

Provide a short overall quality rating (High / Moderate / Low) with a brief justification.

---

## 6) Synthesis and reporting

- Create a summary table listing each included study and the key outcomes.
- If meta-analysis is not feasible, provide a narrative synthesis structured by intervention type and outcome domain.
- Highlight consistent effects and note heterogeneity and limitations.

---

## 7) Documentation (example row)

**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Database:** PubMed
**Search string:** ("communication training" AND "workplace") AND (randomized OR trial)
**Results:** 1,432
**Notes:** After title/abstract screen, 47 potentially relevant; 12 full texts retrieved.

## 8) Tips & resources
- Use university library access for subscription databases.
- Contact a research librarian for advanced search strategies.
- Consider limiting to higher-quality designs when drawing practice recommendations.

If you'd like, I can: (a) populate this file with results from an initial quick Google Scholar sweep (summary of top 5 papers), or (b) add a checklist UI to the dashboard that lets you mark screening progress. Tell me which and I'll implement it next.
